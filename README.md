Improvements for the [OptiTrack](https://www.optitrack.com/) Python [NatNetSDK](https://optitrack.com/products/natnet-sdk/) 

I tried the official SDK on Python 2, but it didn't work. Then I found this thread https://forums.naturalpoint.com/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=14929&p=64917&hilit=python+sdk#p64917
and decided to fix it myself ;)  

Additionally, it had problems to work when the system had multiple network interfaces and I also fixed that :D  


It still needs more tests...
